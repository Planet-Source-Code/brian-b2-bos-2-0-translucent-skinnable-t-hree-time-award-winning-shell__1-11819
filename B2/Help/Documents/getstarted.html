In the past, you had relitively little control over how your desktop looked. You could change the colors or the wallpaper, but that was about it.
That's how B2 is different. Instead of relying on lots of complicated settings for each element of the desktop, it uses skins. Skins are a group
of settings, images, and sounds working together to create an overall "harmony" between all the elements of the desktop. They control the colors,
fonts, sounds, effects, images, and more to completelly change the way a desktop looks. You can choose from any of the included B2 skins, download
new ones from the Internet, get them from friends, or even make your own skins.<br><br>
B2 is similar to Explorer in many ways. Explorer is nothing more than a program. When you start your computer, Explorer displays your Taskbar,
Start Menu, and Desktop Icons. B2 is designed to replace Explorer with a smaller, easier to use, more customizable version. To learn about some
